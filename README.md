# Dublin-based-Music-Band-Data-Analysis-Visualization

Developed a PyQt6 application for analysing and visualizing song data for a music band. Processed and queried CSV datasets containing song details, play history, and audience requests. Implemented interactive UI to filter and display song trends, play frequencies, and other insights. Generated dynamic visualizations (histograms, bar charts, pie charts) using Matplotlib & Pandas. Ensured error handling and data integrity for smooth user experience.
